1. Coding Style

	You should follow the style of the file you're editing. In general, we
	try to follow the rules below.

	1) indent with tabs, and a tab is always 8 characters wide
	2) opening braces are on the same line as the if statement
	3) no braces in an if-body with just one statement
	4) if one of the branches of an if-else codition has braces, than the
	   other branch should also have braces
	5) there is always an empty line between variable declarations and the code

	static int
	my_function(void)
	{
		int a = 0;
		if (a)
			b();
		else
			c();
		if (a) {
			b();
			c();
		} else {
			d();
		}
	}

	6) lines should be less than 80 characters wide
	7) when breaking lines with functions calls, the parameters are aligned
	   with the opening parenthesis
	8) when assigning a variable with the result of a function call, if the
	   line would be longer we break it around the equal '=' sign if it makes sense

	long_variable_name =
		function_with_a_really_long_name(parameter1, parameter2,
						 parameter3, parameter4);
	x = function_with_a_really_long_name(parameter1, parameter2,
					     parameter3, parameter4);
